# InteractiveProgramming
This is the base repo for the interactive programming project for Software Design, Spring 2016 at Olin College.

Project Proposal: Software Design Project 4 Interactive Programming Proposal Margaret Rosner & Aurora Bunten

Main Idea

We want to create a computer program that will allow the user to use the computer keyboard to  play music. It will also have a visualization component where a certain note/key corresponds to a specific color and position of a pattern on the screen. Thus the user can create music and visual art simultaneously. 

Minimum Viable Product

Our minimal viable product will be to click a key and have that key produce a note and a color on the screen.

Stretch Goal:

Have multiple instrument and key options as well as have the type of pattern that appears on the screen be chosen by the user.

Learning Goals:

We both want to gain more experience with Python as well as user interface coding. Aurora wants to learn more about human computer interface and Maggie hope to get better at using Github for collaboration.

Libraries:

Pygame and TBD one library that has musical notes.

By the mid-project check in:

Hopefully we will have out MVP and be able to show it working.

Biggest Risk:
Our biggest risk is that we underestimate the scope of the project and then the MVP ends up being a lot harder to accomplish than we originally thought.
